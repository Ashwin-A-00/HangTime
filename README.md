## Project Description
HangTime is a **smart laundry timing app** that tells you *exactly* when to hang your clothes outside based on **real-time weather data**.  
It calculates **drying times**, gives **weather alerts**, and even suggests fun activities while you wait.  

---

## The Problem (That Doesn‚Äôt Exist)
Who has the time (or patience) to check the weather, calculate humidity, and guess if their socks will dry before the rain?  
People are wasting *precious minutes* staring at clouds and hoping their laundry survives. The struggle is‚Ä¶ questionably real. üß¶‚òÅÔ∏è  

---

## The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)
We built an app that does all the thinking for you:  
- Enter your **location**  
- Select your **clothing type**  
- Get **precise drying time estimates** with a beautiful **bento grid dashboard**  
- Enjoy curated activity suggestions while you wait ‚Äî Netflix, YouTube Music, Kindle, or even stretching tutorials  
- All with **animated particles** in the background, because why not?
